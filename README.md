### What is ERC-20?

The ERC-20 introduces a standard for Fungible Tokens, in other words, they have a property that makes each Token be exactly the same (in type and value) of another Token. For example, an ERC-20 Token acts just like the ETH, meaning that 1 Token is and will always be equal to all the other Tokens.

The ERC-20 (Ethereum Request for Comments 20), proposed by Fabian Vogelsteller in November 2015, is a Token Standard that implements an API for tokens within Smart Contracts.

### Example functionalities ERC-20 provides:

- transfer tokens from one account to another
- get the current token balance of an account
- get the total supply of the token available on the network
- approve whether an amount of token from an account can be spent by a third-party account

### How to run tests:

```
truffle test
```
